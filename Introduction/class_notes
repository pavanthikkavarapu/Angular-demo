    Angular is the Platform used for developing web and mobile applications.


Angular1.x.
    - Angular1.x called as AngularJS.

Component.

    - Encapsulates the "Template" , "data" and "behaviour of View"

    - Collection of "Business Logic" with "Metadata" Technically Called as Component.

    - Genarally we will implement the Business Logic in TypeScript.

    - Genarally we will provide the MetaData by using Decorators in TypeScript.

    - Angular2 Application Must Contain At Least One Component.

    - As a Angular2 Developer We can take more than one Component per Application

    - We can Place One Component into Another Component.

    - As a Angular2 Developer we can provide Communication Between Components.


Ex.
   first.ts.
   -

   import {  Component } from 'angular2/core'

    @Component({
        selector : "my_app",
        template : "<div [name]></div>"
    })
   export class Test{
        var name : string = "Welcome to First Component";
   }


   boot.ts
   -
   import { bootstrap } form 'angular2/platform/browser'
   import { Test } from 'first'
   bootstrap(Test)

   index.html
   -
    <html>
       <my_app></my_app>
       <script>
            System.import(" boot.js").then(err,res);
        </script>
    </html>
